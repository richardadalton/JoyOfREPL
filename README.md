# JoyOfREPL
**Richard Dalton**

### Summary

This talk will show how the REPL can be used to work towards a solution incrementally, using experimentation rather than (or in conjunction with) tests. During the talk I will work from an empty IDE to a solution for the Diamond Kata, using the REPL to explore the problem, write and test smaller functions, and combine them into a working solution.
